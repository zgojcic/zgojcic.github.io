I"ê<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/ilogcplex/">CPLEX</a> is a pretty awesome optimization toolbox from IBM, and it is free for academic use. It can be called from C++ (apart from Matlab, Python, etc.), but it‚Äôs not the easiest library to compile‚Ä¶
You will encounter some problems for instance if your code has some C++11 functionalities from the C++ standard library.</p>
