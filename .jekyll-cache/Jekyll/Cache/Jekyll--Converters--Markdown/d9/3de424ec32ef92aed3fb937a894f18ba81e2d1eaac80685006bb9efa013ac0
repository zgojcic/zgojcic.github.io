I"¿<p>So here we are again to measure the presence of deep learning in the major vision conferences, with one more to the list. Here you can check the previous <a href="http://localhost:4000/deep-learning-scraping/">posts</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/deep-learning-plateau/">of</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/deep-learning-takes-over-again/">the</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/deep-learning-evolution/">saga</a>.<br />
<br />
Here the evolution of the results using XKCD style, as described in this <a href="http://localhost:4000/xkcd-deep-learning/">blog post</a>:
