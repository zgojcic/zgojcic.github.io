I"T<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/ilogcplex/">CPLEX</a> is a pretty awesome optimization toolbox from IBM, and it is free for academic use. It can be called from C++ (apart from Matlab, Python, etc.), but it’s not the easiest library to compile…
You will encounter some problems for instance if your code has some C++11 functionalities from the C++ standard library.</p>

<p><br />
Long story short, CPLEX requires the flag <code class="highlighter-rouge">-stdlib=libstdc++</code>, which <em>downgrades</em> the version of the standard library to a version where the C++11 functionalities where not available by default.
This way, your part of the code with C++11 won’t compile.</p>

<p><br />
The good part is that you can still use the C++11 code by including the <em>Technical Report 1</em> part of the library, that is, by adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">tr1/</code> to the files that the compiler does not found and changing <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::</code> by <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::tr1::</code> in the functions that are not found.</p>
