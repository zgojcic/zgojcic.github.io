I"<p>Once more, let’s plot the evolution of deep learning in the major vision conferences.
Here you can check the <a href="http://localhost:4000/dl-lstm-gan-evolution">previous</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/deep-learning-scraping/">posts</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/deep-learning-plateau/">of</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/deep-learning-takes-over-again/">the</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/deep-learning-evolution/">saga</a>.<br />
<br />
Here the plot using XKCD style, as described in this <a href="http://localhost:4000/xkcd-deep-learning/">blog post</a>, where again we separate the two conferences, as introduced in my <a href="http://localhost:4000/dl-lstm-gan-evolution">previous post</a>.

<p>We see that the presence of these keywords is still growing in ECCV and ICCV, with CVPR slightly ahead; but saturating in both.

<br />
What about the new kids in class (LSTMs and GANs)?

Nice boost! They’re already in the title of 4% of the papers, not bad. Will they reach the 25% of the generic deep learning?</p>
