I"¡<p>In the following tutorials Iâ€™ll explain how to solve Sudoku puzzles using C++ and <a href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV</a>. Weâ€™ll build a program that captures the webcam video, looks for a Sudoku grid, locates and recognizes the numbers, solves the puzzle, and reprojects the result on the grid (augmented-reality); all in real time. Spoiler alert! Here the link to the final result video :)  <br />
